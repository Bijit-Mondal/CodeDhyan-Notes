# Variables in Java
A variable is a name given to a memory location. It is the basic unit of storage in a program, a variable is a value that can change, depending on conditions or on information passed to the program. With the help of variables, we can refer to the **objects** or the **value** and use them throughout the program. The variable in java has a `data type`  a `name` and a `value`. The data type of the variable specifies the type of value that can be stored in the variable such as `Integer`, `Boolean`, `Double` or `String` value. The name will be used to refer to the variable in the code and the value is the data that is stored in the variable.

```java
int num = 10;
```
Data Type - `int`\
Variable Name - `num`\
Value - `10`

## Types of Variable
There are three types of variable present in java
- Local Variable
- Instance Variable
- Class or Static Variable

We will discuss about these types in later articles.
