# INTRODUCTION

Hi everyone. We will be discussing a very interesting topic here, with a very basic and beginner-friendly approach. I expect all the readers of this content to be aware of the recent developments in the field of Computer Science because it will help to understand the article.
So, let’s begin with some buzzwords. ‘*Data Science’, ‘Artificial Intelligence’, ‘Machine Learning’, ‘Deep Learning’, ‘Computer Vision’, ‘Natural Language Processing*’… so many of them. I will try to explain each of them one by one. 

##### *Artificial Intelligence* -   
You can think of it as grandfather or great-grandfather in the family tree. He resides at the top, and all the other members are direct or indirect descendants of him. Artificial Intelligence is the study in which we practice to make our machines work for us. Now you might think that my machine already works for me, if I give it a task it will do it in the blink of an eye. You are right. But that’s not the machine entirely, that is doing it. There is a brain of a certain programmer who programmed the machine to do that job. AI tries to enable the machine to do the job automatically, without being pre-programmed. Now, AI is the grandfather because all the other buzzwords are descendants of this. You will understand more as we go forward.

#### *Machine Learning* -
A subfield of Artificial Intelligence. To explain it simply, Machine Learning is a collection of different mathematical models. Machine Learning is the basis of any Artificial Intelligence based development. In ML, different algorithms are used to obtain results using different types of data. 

#### *Deep Learning* -
If we add Neural Networks to Machine Learning, it becomes Deep Learning. Wait for a second. What is Neural Network?? Let me explain. We all know that our body is comprised of millions of neurons. They have a structure. If you don’t remember it, I would suggest you revise it on Google because that will help in understanding the Neural Network. The Neural Network is a collection of neurons, and these neurons are mathematical implementations of the actual physical neurons that we have in our body. If you find it difficult now don’t worry. Things will get easy with time. 

#### *Computer Vision* -
We can describe Computer Vision as an application of Deep Learning. It is a field where machines are taught to perform vision-related tasks. To do this, we add Image Processing with Machine Learning and Neural Networks. Image Processing is the study of manipulating images using different algorithms.

#### *Natural Language Processing* -
This is another application of Deep Learning. It is a field where machines are taught to perform text or language-related tasks. Here we perform Text Processing or Language Processing with Machine Learning. Text Processing is the study of manipulating texts using different algorithms. 

#### *Data Science* -
It’s a very closely related subject to all the topics discussed above. There is a very narrow difference. In Data Science all the above techniques are used as per needed, to perform a bigger task, often relevant to corporate benefits. Data Science is the study of processing structured or unstructured data and then using them to build different models that will perform AI tasks. It is a very basic explanation of the field but I think it’s sufficient for now.
