# What is Data Structure and Algorithms?

An algorithm and a data structure go hand in hand. A set of data may be arranged in a specific structure, which is then passed into an algorithm to be executed in a particular manner.

Algorithms and data structures are not the same thing. In order to understand them better, let's take a look at them separately.

## What is Data?
Things aren't data, but information about them is data. \
e.g. - "*Age* of people".  
Here Age is Data. We process data to solve our problems.
## Why to structure the Data?
Structuring data is crucial for various tasks. Consider the scenario of **Find a Book in a Library**. \
*Problem* - Imagine a library where books are piled randomly on shelves, without any order or catalog system. Finding a specific book would require tediously scanning every shelf, leading to wasted time.
*Solution* - Arranging books alphabetically on shelves creates an efficient `array` structure, allowing for quick lookups based on book titles. \
or Suppose a problem arise **Handling Customer Orders at a Restaurant**. \
*Problem* -  A restaurant that takes orders without prioritizing might serve them out of order, which leads to confusion and dissatisfaction of customer. \
*Solution* - A `queue` data structure ensures `first-come, first-served` fairness. It's like a line where customers enter at the back and get served from the front, ensuring orderly processing.

The importance of structuring data becomes evident in preventing inefficiencies and streamlining processes. Disorganized data will need a lot time to process leading to inefficiency., while structured data, facilitated by data structures, enhances efficiency in problem-solving endeavors.

## What is Data Structure?
A data structure is a particular way data is arranged so it can be saved in memory and retrieved for later use.
